    "efficiency_disclaimer": "**Note on Weighted Efficiency Calculation:** \nThis score is calculated using a **direct weighted sum** of all production values multiplied by your assigned point weights. \n1.  **Point Values:** Each metric is multiplied by the points you assign (e.g., 1 FP = 10 points). \n2.  **Boost Integration:** Boost buildings are automatically converted and added to their base metrics (e.g., +10% FP boost = +50 FP/day added to forge_points if you produce 500 FP/day). You only set weights for base metrics. \n3.  **Total Score:** All weighted values are summed to get the Total Score. \n4.  **Efficiency Points:** The **Weighted Efficiency** is the **Total Score** divided by building size (tiles including road). \n*This approach preserves real production differences and automatically scales boost values based on your actual city production.*",
